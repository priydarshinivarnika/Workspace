Student Id         :   1001
Qualifying marks   :   80.0
Residential status :   H
Year of Engineering:   3

Output:
Student Name       :   Jacob
Student Id         :   1001
Qualifying marks   :   80.0
Year of Engineering:   3
Residential status :   Hostellers
 
Input 2:
Attribute             Value
Student Name       :   Peter
Student Id         :   1002
Qualifying marks   :   83.0
Residential status :   D
Year of Engineering:   2

Output:
Student Name       :   Peter
Student Id         :   1002
Qualifying marks   :   83.0
Year of Engineering:   2
Residential status :   Day Scholar
 
Summary:
I have used both setter and constructor to demonstrate way to assign values to the attributes.
Implemented convertingResidentialStatus()within the pojo class that takes char(H/D) value and convert it into String(Hostellers/Day Scholar) as required.
Implemented toString method n pojo class makes it more organized and abstract and even no need to write sysout for every object created.
